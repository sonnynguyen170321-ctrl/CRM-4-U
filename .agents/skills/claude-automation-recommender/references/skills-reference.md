# Skills Recommendations

Skills are packaged expertise with workflows, reference materials, and best practices. Create them in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Skills can be invoked by Claude automatically when relevant, or by users directly with `/skill-name`.

Some pre-built skills are available through official plugins (install via `/plugin install`).

**Note**: These are common patterns. Use web search to find skill ideas specific to the codebase's tools and frameworks.

Create project-specific skills in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.

### Skill Structure

```
.claude/skills/
└── my-skill/
    ├── SKILL.md           # Main instructions (required)

allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob # Restrict tool access
context: fork                   # Run in isolated subagent
agent: Explore                  # Which agent type when forked

### API Documentation with OpenAPI Template

Apply a YAML template to generate consistent API docs:

```
.claude/skills/api-doc/
├── SKILL.md
└── openapi-template.yaml
```

**SKILL.md:**
```yaml
---
name: api-doc
description: Generate OpenAPI documentation for an endpoint. Use when documenting APIs.
---
# API Documentation Generator
Instruct the model how to write API documentation conforming to the OpenAPI specification.
```
